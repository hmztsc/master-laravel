Section 23 : Authentication
#108. Authentication overview
------------------------------------------------  

php artisan make:auth

yeni 
php artisan ui:auth

wrote this command just to show how auth operations files happen automatically

routes in web.php Auth::routes(); deleted it, showed the routes, then reverted it back to its original state.
Now we will do all the operations ourselves in the next lesson.
