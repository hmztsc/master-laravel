Section 23 : Authentication
#107. IMPORTANT: Laravel 7 and Laravel 8 Changes
------------------------------------------------  

Laravel 7 & 8 changes
Since Laravel 7 it does not provide authentication controllers out of the box (as it did previously and during the recording of this course).

You need to install the UI package, using the below command:

composer require laravel/ui

Then run this command to generate the controllers inside :

php artisan ui:controllers

You should see something like this:

Http\Controllers\Auth\VerificationController.php
